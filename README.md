### Project Overview
PostgreSQL Data Model: The database is structured using a well-defined schema to manage relationships and constraints, ensuring data integrity and efficiency.

Java Application: A Java-based application is developed to interact with the database, using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for connecting, querying, and modifying the data stored in PostgreSQL.

### Features

Table Consulting: The application allows users to query the database and retrieve data from different tables.

Data Modification: Users can insert, update, and delete records in the PostgreSQL tables through the Java interface.

Connection Management: The application handles PostgreSQL connections using JDBC, ensuring safe and optimized interactions with the database.
Technologies Used

PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source relational database system used to manage the data.

Java: A high-level, class-based programming language used for application development.

JDBC: The Java Database Connectivity API used to connect and interact with the PostgreSQL database.

SQL: Structured Query Language is used for querying and modifying the database.

### Key Functionalities

Database Setup:
A detailed PostgreSQL data model for handling structured data with well-defined relationships and constraints (e.g., foreign keys, unique constraints).

Java Application:

Database Connection: Establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL database using JDBC.

Table Consultation: Executes SQL queries to retrieve data from tables.

Data Insertion: Inserts new rows into the tables.

Data Update: Updates existing records based on specified conditions.

Data Deletion: Deletes records from tables as required.
